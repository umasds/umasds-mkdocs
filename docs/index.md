*This project is still under heavy development!*

# What is Social Data Science?
Much like [*Data Science*](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
as the more general term *Social Data Science* has no clear definition 
either. In the context of this website it is just the title of a course 
on applications of data science methods in quantitative social research.

## Teaching Data Science skills
Students of social sciences acquire a lot of substantive expertise
in several subjects like sociology, psychology, politics, economics etc.
They also learn mathematics and statistics as part of their research 
methods training. What the social scienitific curriculum is missing in 
most cases are hacking skills which are needed to become a full-blown 
*Social Data Scientist*.

One of our course goals is therefore to provide the students with the 
necessary skills to apply data science techniques to social research
questions. Since we cannot expect a strong IT background or affinity, we
try to introduce concepts like programming, version control etc. as 
gently as possible. At the same time we want to provide at least a 
minimal skill set in handling state of the art data science tools. 

Installing the necessary programs and getting them to run properly on 
each computer can be a time consuming and frustrating process especially 
for the less tech savvy. We therefore provide a 
[virtual machine](vm.md) running a completely prepared, easy-to-use 
[Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) desktop with all tools 
that are covered in the course already pre-installed. Of course all 
programs used are free software and most are under an open source 
licence.
